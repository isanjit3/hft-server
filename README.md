- Enhanced order matching
This setup should now handle more complex matching scenarios, including partial fills and maintaining the order of orders based on price priority.

Hybrid Approach with Novel On-Chain Elements:

Base Matching Off-Chain: Perform the bulk of the order matching off-chain to ensure high performance and scalability.
Innovative On-Chain Components: Introduce novel on-chain elements, such as periodic snapshots of the order book, on-chain verification of off-chain matches, or using zk-SNARKs for zero-knowledge proofs of off-chain matching correctness.
Transparency and Trust: Ensure that matched orders are recorded on-chain for transparency and trust, and provide users with the ability to audit the off-chain matching process through cryptographic proofs.
Implementation Steps
Smart Contract for Order Recording:

Define a smart contract to record placed and matched orders.
Include functions for adding orders and confirming matches with proofs.
Off-Chain Matching Engine:

Develop a high-performance matching engine that operates off-chain.
Integrate with the smart contract to periodically update the blockchain with matched orders.
Cryptographic Proofs:

Implement zero-knowledge proofs or Merkle trees to allow users to verify the correctness of the off-chain matching.
